# Question 1:
# Write some code that prompts the user for their age. Depending on the input:
# If the age is less than 13, print "You are a child."
input_number = int(input("Enter a age: "))
if input_number < 13: 
    print("negative")
    print("You are a child")
# If the age is between 13 and 19, print "You are a teenager."
input_number = int(input("Enter a age: "))
age = int(intput("Enter your age: "))
if 13 < age < 19: 
    print("Your a teenager")
else:
    print("Your not a teenager")
# If the age is 20 or older, print "You are an adult."
input_number = int(input("Enter a age "))
if input_number > 20: 
    print("You are an adult")

# Question 2:
# Write some code to display the following pattern using a for or while loop:
# 1
for i in range(1):
    print("1")
# 12
for i in range(12):
    print ("12")
# 123
for i in range(123):
    print("123")
# 1234
for i in range(1234):
    print("1234")
# 12345
for i in range(12345):
    print("12345")

# Question 3:
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to input 10 numbers. After all the numbers are inputted, the program should display:

# The highest number.
for i in range(10):
    input_number = int(input("Enter a number" ))
    sum+= input_number
    highest = max + 10
# The lowest number.
input_number = int(int("Enter a number "))
sum+= input_number
lowest = min
# The average of all the numbers.
for i in range (10)
input_number = int(input("Enter a number "))
sum += input_number
average = sum / 10 
print(average)
# Question 4:
# Vowel Counter - Write some code that prompts the user to enter a string. The program should then display the number of vowels in the string. IE. If the user enters "Hello World", the program should display 3.
# the vowels are a, e, i, o, u
input_number = input("Enter a string")
vowel_counter = ("a, e, i, o,u") 
# Hint: convert the string to lowercase and use a for loop with a counter variable and an if statement
